This folder contains the concept maps created by this workshop's instructors.

Each concept map should have the following naming convention:

    [lesson name]_[instructor #1]_[instructor #2].[file extension]

There is no restriction on file type. It can be a screen shot, a picture of a white
board, a text file, etc. 

* The concept map must map to the respective SC lesson
* Both instructors must be in agreement of the concept map
* Concept maps will be used with [formative assesments](http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/02-novice/)
* Nearly all of the lessons have MCQs (Multiple choice questions). Please take a look at the MCQs within your respective lesson, and use as many as possible for your _formative assesments_.
* The concept map for the capstone _must not_ include any concepts not previously covered. The capstone _may_ have some kind of "extra credit" goal which covers a previously uncovered concept.
